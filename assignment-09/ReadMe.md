## ReadMe Qs
1.  It was almost all new. I have toyed with Python & ArcGIS but do not have any formal HTML training (until this semester). I was fascinated to piece together a website!

2. I am worried about complicating HTML when I am still getting the hang of things. Having the MART341 website is a huge asset as it allows me to easily access the foundational elements of web design.

3. I spent too much time deciding what instructable to construct. I then spent too much time picking & choosing resources. Even though the planning phase took a lot of time, I had so much fun in the process. I referred to old homework assignments and Professor Cassens example repo for this week's website. I had some trouble with tables but between the MART341 site and google, I pieced together a table.
