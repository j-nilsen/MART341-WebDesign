        <h1>How to Research & Reach<br /> a Fire Lookout in Montana</h1>
        <p>Before aviation was used as a means of fire detection, the Forest Service had a robust network of fire lookouts. While regularly staffed lookouts still exist, they are rare. Finding your way to a lookout is a unique experience within our National Forests. Below you will learn how to find, prepare for, and summit a fire lookout.</p>
        <p>A suggested order of operation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Ideate</b>: Determine the region in which you would like to hike. Where are (or were) the lookouts in the desired zone?</li>
            <li><b>Research</b>: Is the lookout still standing? If so, what information - past & present - can you gather?</li>
            <li><b>Route Plan</b>: How will we get there? Is the lookout on public land? Are the trails maintained? Research hazards and news about the region.</li>
            <li><b>Head Out!</b> Charge your phone (GPS), print a map, pack up, and hit the road.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>What's out there?</h4>
        <p>Before we can narrow our search, let's use a combination of online resources (such as the below <a href="https://www.firelookout.com/lktpix.html">maps</a> and <a href="https://www.firelookout.com/lktpix.html">registry</a>) and topo maps to find where lookouts were (and reportedly still are).</p>

        <h4>Is it still standing?</h4>
          <p>With the introduction of aerial detection, lookouts started to become obsolete. Since then, lookouts have either been abandon, destroyed, or restored. Making sure your journey leads to a structure (and not a pile of debris) is essential. Use a combination of photos and Google Earth to help determine if your journey is worthwhile.</p>

          <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1083.7227200332563!2d-112.71756684973623!3d46.84175880101716!2m3!1f349.9853587115674!2f26.49677985183557!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f35!3m3!1m2!1s0x535cc3b4aaee58a1%3A0xef6178a78086adcc!2sDalton%20Mountain!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1635797561986!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="466" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p>Above is a photo of the Dalton Mountain Lookout being decommissioned by the Forest Service. Beside the photo is satelite imagery of the tower location. Use the 3D function to scout the summit for a structure. As you can see, the lookout is gone. What's worth noting: if the summit is not under canopy, the views are still probably fantastic!</p>
        <h4>If these walls could talk...</h4>
          <p>Lookouts are steeped in history. Delve into library archives and see if you can find information or anecdotes about the 100 year old structures. Below, Bud Moore recounts what he knows of <dfn title="mokus (also mocus): US slang - lonliness, depression; (with the) a state of depression, 'the blues'">Mocus</dfn> Point Lookout in the Lochsa District.</p>

        <h2>Route Planning</h2>
        <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
        <p>Sometimes land around lookouts have been sold, making access difficult. First, locate your lookout on the Montana Cadastral Map (hint: zoom in close enough to use the topo basemap). The map will have details about landowners. It is advisable to call to ask for permission to access their land.</p>
        <a href="http://svc.mt.gov/msl/mtcadastral"><img src="./images/mt_cadastral_mineral-example.png" width="800" alt="MT Parcel Lookup Map Screenshot" title="Mineral Lookout Parcel Lookup"/></a>

        <p>Another resource is CalTopo's public land overlay. The feature color-codes the map to denote public, state, BLM, Tribal, and private land.</p>
        <iframe src="https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=47.00203,-113.79948&z=13&b=t&a=sma" width="500" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>
        <p>Now that you have an idea of where to go and what to expect, it's time to get moving. Pack appropriate layers, bring food & water, and let someone know where you'll be going. Have fun, find solitude, and step back in time.
