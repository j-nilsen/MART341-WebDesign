1. Below are three sites I enjoy visiting (I linked specific pages as examples)
 - [Mineral Hill](https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=65591) on [Peakbagger](https://www.peakbagger.com)
 - [North Fork of the Blackfoot River](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/12338300/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D&compare=true) on [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)
 - [Stonewall Mountain](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=47.04305,-112.71604&z=14&b=f16a&a=sf%2Csma) on [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/)


2. As Vint Cern explains: our computers use the DNS to look up domain names to find the associated IP Address. The DNS decodes our requested destination (domain name) and communicates its IP Address.

3. David Karp analogizes cookies to ID cards. When we communicate with a desired server, the server sends – along with the requested webpage – a cookie. The cookie allows the server to better recognize our devices (for future use). Our web browser then stores the cookie which allows for efficient communication.

4. The three essential parts of a URL are:
 1. Protocol
 2. Domain
 3. Paths
