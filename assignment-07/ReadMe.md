## ReadMe Qs
1. A type of form I have come across while browsing the web is a job application. The form serves to gather job applicants' information and experience. These forms use many ```type="text"``` and ```textarea``` inputs. I imagine form building a job application is a lengthy & complex task!

2. Examples of a text, selection, and button input:
  - ```type="text"``` is a text input which renders a text box; these can be used for processing ID/password sign-ins, birth dates, or email addresses
  - ```type="radio"``` is a selection input that gives end-users a static set of options (i.e. a question or inquiry with predefined responses of A, B, or C)
  - ```type="file"``` is a button input that allows users to select & upload files


3. Throughout Assignment 7, I referenced ```./assignment-06``` and Professor Cassens' example repo. At first, I wanted to put the two gym locations into a table, but I found the inclusion of addresses and emails to get messy. Additionally, I thought it would be helpful to include a map with two pins to illustrate where the gyms are located within Seattle. For another day...

    As I was building the page, I became a little agitated to see my page so one-sided. I began to play with ```text-align```, and was only partially successful (my selection type looked wonky - like descending stairs). I made peace with my page and spent time making aesthetic touch-ups. Professor Cassens helped in rectifying an issue with my operating hours (there was a break in a bottom border). Next, I became interested in building a form that would send the actual commentary to an email. This proved to be an undertaking for my skill level (and I didn't feel at liberty to send rogue emails to my climbing gym). I finished with adding a linked Bouldering Project emblem and links to other Bouldering Projects.
