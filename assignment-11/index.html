      <p id="first-stanza">You might come here Sunday on a whim.<br />
        Say your life broke down. The last good kiss<br />
        you had was years ago. You walk these streets<br />
        laid out by the insane, past hotels<br />
        that didn’t last, bars that did, the tortured try<br />
        of local drivers to accelerate their lives.<br />
        Only churches are kept up. The jail<br />
        turned 70 this year. The only prisoner<br />
        is always in, not knowing what he’s done.<br /></p>

      <p>The principal supporting business now<br />
        is rage. Hatred of the various grays<br />
        the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,<br />
        The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls<br />
        who leave each year for Butte. One good<br />
        restaurant and bars can’t wipe the boredom out.<br />
        The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,<br />
        a dance floor built on springs—<br />
        all memory resolves itself in gaze,<br />
        in panoramic green you know the cattle eat<br />
        or two stacks high above the town,<br />
        two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse<br />
        for fifty years that won’t fall finally down.<br /></p>

      <p>Isn’t this your life? That ancient kiss<br />
        still burning out your eyes? Isn’t this defeat<br />
        so accurate, the church bell simply seems<br />
        a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?<br />
        Don’t empty houses ring? Are magnesium<br />
        and scorn sufficient to support a town,<br />
        not just Philipsburg, but towns<br />
        of towering blondes, good jazz and booze<br />
        the world will never let you have<br />
        until the town you came from dies inside?<br /></p>

      <p>Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty<br />
        when the jail was built, still laughs<br />
        although his lips collapse. Someday soon,<br />
        he says, I’ll go to sleep and not wake up.<br />
        You tell him no. You’re talking to yourself.<br />
        The car that brought you here still runs.<br />
        The money you buy lunch with,<br />
        no matter where it’s mined, is silver<br />
        and the girl who serves your food<br />
        is slender and her red hair lights the wall.<br /></p>
