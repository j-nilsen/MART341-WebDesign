  <ul>
    <li><b>Pick 1 issue/aspect/topic from each week and connect it to something you'd like to change in your own life (personal or professional).</b>  For example, for Week 1, I could choose my white privilege.  For Week 3, I could (and did) choose feminism's problematic foremothers.</li><br />
    <li>Your assignment is then to reflect on how to make changes in your life around that issue.  You should <b>come up with 2 ideas to make that change.</b>  Your ideas do not need to be original--if you want to change your language, that can be one of your ideas, but you'll need to discuss concrete things you'll do to make that change.  So you'd identify the problematic language you find yourself using, even if infrequently.  And an example of how to commit to change could be a non-inclusive language jar where you put money in each time you make a mistake around language and then donate it to a DEI group (include which one in your finished project), or commit to volunteering X number of hours, if the change jar isn't feasible.</li><br />
    <li>Format: whatever you want.  It can be a typed paper, with bullet points.  It can be a PowerPoint.  It could be a video.  It could be a series of social media posts.  It could be a collage or a series of art pieces showing a before and after.</li><br />
    <li>So, <b>five issues (1 from each week) each with 2 concrete ways to enact change around that issue on an individual level.</b>  All of your issues and examples can be from your professional life, or from your personal life, or a combination.  For students: professional = student life of classes, etc.</li>
