    <h1 id="subheader">Understanding Privilege & Oppression</h1>
    <p><b>Week 1 Issue:</b><em> White Privilege</em> – While I am only beginning my journey into learning about the depths of my privilege, <a href="https://psychology.umbc.edu/files/2016/10/White-Privilege_McIntosh-1989.pdf" target="_blank">McIntosh</a>’s definitions of privilege have provided a framework in which I can better acknowledge my advantages. Her writings have implored me to examine the givens in my life and how they are a result of systemic privilege. How can I combat this? How can I better acknowledge this? Acknowledging privilege is strange in that it invokes guilt and shame. However, I think its function goes beyond self-reproach. I think it is more productive to hold people – myself, my family, friends, and political representatives – accountable. That being said, I want to emphasize that I am working on my own privilege and biases. Last semester, I learned about settler colonialism in the context of environmentalism, and it pushed me to learn the indigenous histories of the places I have lived. While I am still unlearning the history I learned in school, I want to build upon that unlearning through other facets such as race and gender.</p>
    <p><b>Change 1:</b> Becoming an ally through media & involvement – seeking out <a href="https://goodblacknews.org/2020/06/04/acknowledging-your-privilege-and-becoming-an-ally-a-guide-to-resources-for-white-folks/" target="_blank">resources</a> that emphasize the plight of both historic and contemporary racism will help cultivate an understanding of how I benefit while others don't. Via literature, films, and local organizations, I can equip myself with knowledge to become a better ally and fight inequality.</p>

    <p><b>Change 2:</b> Donating time and/or money – <a href="https://www.realrentduwamish.org/" target="_blank">Real Rent Duwamish</a> asks Seattle residents to pay a small rent to the Duwamish Tribe whose treaty has not been upheld. The Duwamish are not federally recognized, and thus, risk cultural erasure. While living in Seattle (where I was for most of this course), I failed to properly acknowledge not only my privilege but also the way that the city has pushed out the Duwamish Tribe. I am currently moving to Central Oregon. There (and wherever I go in the <a href="https://native-land.ca/" target="_blank">future</a>), I will seek out similar organizations – those that bolster and honor indigenous populations.<p/>

    <h1 id="subheader">Intersectionality</h1>
    <p><b>Week 2 Issue:</b><em> "Missing White Woman Syndrome"</em> – <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039" target="_blank">Crenshaw</a> refers to the disproportionate distribution of Black women killed by police as a framing problem. She emphasizes: <q>if you can't see a problem, you can't solve a problem.</q> Likewise, missing POC receive far less media attention than missing white people. When the scales are tipped so heavily in one direction, how can an individual begin to advocate for
    equality? The translation of online activism to offline spaces is a cumbersome and nuanced process. We are in the midst of learning how to galvanize online and activate outside. A push for institutional reform comes from accountability, staying informed, and showing-up.</p>
    <p><b>Change 1:</b> When online, I can click, like, post, share stories that are about missing people of color – both to learn and spread awareness. Actively engaging in these types of posts – instead of scrolling past the headlines – helps show a demand for these stories. Actively engaging online shows journalists, advertisers, media outlets, and algorithims that people care about these stories.</p>
    <p><b>Change 2:</b> I can support <a href="https://www.hoka.com/en/us/blog-post/?id=time-to-reconnect-native-womens-wilderness" target="_blank">brands</a>, <a href="https://www.nativewomenswilderness.org/mmiw" target="_blank">organizations</a>, and <a href="https://owamni.com/" target="_blank">businesses</a> that are inclusive of POC. Seeking out culturally diverse business not only supports a local artist & economy, but also promotes diversity in the marketplace.<p/>

    <h1 id="subheader">History of Gender & Sexuality</h1>
    <p><b>Week 3 Issue:</b><em> Feminism</em> – It is unfortunate that the abrasive connotation of "feminism" has pervaded generations. For being such an innocuous definition, many people still shy away from the word. Labeling ourselves – on & offline – as feminists helps disassociate the negativity that surrounds feminism. If users begin to see “feminist” repeatedly attached to the things and the people they follow, the word becomes less scary. Feminism is not “crazy;” feminism is long overdue equality that all should be in favor of. Embracing this word & movement is of paramount importance.</p>
    <p><b>Change 1:</b> My two sisters are ardent supporters of feminism. I am proudly a feminist thanks to them. Where I can really show my badge of honor is through my day-to-day decisions. My plan is to buy me and my dad “feminist” t-shirts (quite literally labeling ourselves as feminists). While it is not groundbreaking advocacy, it shows support and may even start a conversation.</p>
    <p><b>Change 2:</b> My media consumption, again, speaks to the demand for feminism. I have begun soliciting suggestions from my sisters and others about books & podcasts that delve into feminist issues. My consumption of media not only serves as an education (which can make me a more informed ally), but shows a demand for this kind of content. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any suggestions you might have.<p/>

    <h1 id="subheader">Gender & Sexual Identity Today</h1>
    <p><b>Week 4 Issue:</b><em> Two-Spirited [People]</em> – The term "is usually used to indicate a person whose body simultaneously houses a masculine spirit and a feminine spirit. The term can also be used more abstractly, to indicate the presence of two contrasting human spirits (such as Warrior and Clan Mother)" [<cite>Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition</cite>]. Once a revered people, Two-Spirit People were subject to shame and abandonment once European settlers arrived. The Eurocentric binary categorizations we have come to know are non-inclusive and damaging. Historically, Two-Spirit People were healers, care givers, and medicine givers. Two-Spirit individuals deserve <b>everyone's</b> respect.</p>
    <p><b>Change 1:</b> During my yoga practice, I will seek the teachings of Two-Spirited leaders. In Indian and Southeast Asian cultures, Ardhanarishvara "represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from ... Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa." To praise and practice the teachings of Two-Spiritedness is not only a source of energy and healing, but also celebrates non-binary individuals.</p>
    <p><b>Change 2:</b> I vote for canidates who I believe represent DEI values. I can effect change in my own life by upping my political involvement. I will campaign for candidates that fight for the equality of <b>all</b> individuals. Given the dire fight for decolonization, indiginous rights, and land/tribe acknowledgement, inspiring voter and candidate awareness is key. My DEI advocacy takes on many forms – making sure my side of the world is aware of a candidate that represents the voice of many is something I can do.<p/>

    <h1 id="subheader">Theory into Practice</h1>
    <p><b>Week 5 Issue:</b><em> Underrespresentation</em> – The organizations we join and align with might not always exude fair & even representation. While being asked to a conference, Audre Lorde suggested the absence of lesbian women and Black women "is to assume that lesbian and Black women have nothing to say." This can certainly be extended to other genders, races, and sexualities. While I am not advocating for a check-a-box culture, inclusion of many experiences is not only fair but also misses out on other sides of the story. Hearing about different experiences creates a strong sense of empathy and community. As <a href="https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf" target="_blank">Lorde</a> said: "Difference is that raw and powerful connection from which our personal power is forged." If underrepresentation persists, racism, homophobia, sexism, and xenophobia does as well.</p>

    <p><b>Change 1:</b> I love to ski. I moved to Montana for better access to snow & steeps (Minnesota has the cool temperature but is challenged when it comes to vertical relief). The sport is, as Vail's CEO puts it: "overwhelmingly white." Chuck Harris, a ski coach at Mt. Rose in Nevada, <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/snow-sports/national-brotherhood-skiers-oral-history/" target="_blank">declares:</a></p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/snow-sports/national-brotherhood-skiers-oral-history/">In the marketing materials for most resorts, there’s nobody who looks like me. There’s a dog whistle going on there, and also a red flag. The dog whistle is telling white people, “Hey, this is the perfect safe space for you and your kids.” The red flag is waving at anybody who’s Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Black, or Native American, and it’s saying, “Maybe you’re not quite welcome here."</blockquote>
      <p>In an effort to further access to the sport, I have applied to become a volunteer at the <a href="https://www.sharewinterfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Share Winter Foundation</a> – an organization that seeks to, <q>create a more inclusive, more diverse, and more welcoming winter sports community.</q> Also: I have sent emails to <dfn title="National Brotherhood of Skiing">NBS</dfn> and Share Winter for more information as well as stickers (water bottles, skis, and fridges need stickers – why not show support for winter for all?)
    <p><b>Change 2:</b> A privilege in which I failed to recognize is the way in which I nourish my body; I have not experienced a scenario in which I could not find nourishment that did not “fit with my cultural traditions” (<a href="https://www.collegeart.org/pdf/diversity/white-privilege-and-male-privilege.pdf" target="_blank">McIntosh</a>). Eating food that aligns with me culturally is one of many “daily signals and indications that my people [count]” (<a href="https://www.collegeart.org/pdf/diversity/white-privilege-and-male-privilege.pdf" target="_blank">McIntosh</a>). Two things in which I would like to do for my personal life: spend more time exploring & cooking culturally diverse foods (at least once every 2 weeks), and visit a First Nations Longhouse for a food event. Indiginous cuisine is strikingly underrepresented. By preparing and seeking out foods foreign to me, my privilege can be better illustrated. Food is a cultural cornerstone; making space for other cultures hinders erasure.<p/>
