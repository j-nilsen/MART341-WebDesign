## ReadMe Qs

1. My imaginary client is a small business owner â€“ I had my friend Nathan in mind. He is trying to start a handyman business in the Blackfoot Valley. He needs a way to field new work, engage clientele, and add legitimacy to his business (business cards, website, merchandise). He also needs a way for people to find him (word of mouth only goes so far).

2. It is important to consider a mobile-first design because the amount of mobile-users is staggering. If my friend wants to be taken seriously as a business, he needs a website that loads flawlessly for those who search for him on mobile (the majority, I presume).

3. I wrestled with widths for some time. Stuffing forms, images, and texts into columns took some finessing. Between revisiting Professor Cassen's repo, poring over the MART 341 site, and numerous Google searches, I have overcome some of the challenges. I still have some titles that do not dynamically change in the way I had hoped (a work in progress).
