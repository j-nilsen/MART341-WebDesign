        <p>
          Philip Dey "Phil" Eastman was born in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1909.  After graduating from Amherst College, Eastman moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant animator at Walt Disney. In 1942, he was drafted into the army and worked within the Signal Corps Film Unit. Coincidentally, Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) was the head of this unit. After the army and a stint freelancing, P.D. was approached by Geisel about writing for his Beginner Books series at Random House. In 1958, Random House published his first children's book <i>Sam and the Firefly</i>.
