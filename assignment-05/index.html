    <h1>Go, Dog. Go!</h1>
    <h2>P. D. Eastman</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i> tells the story of a multitude of dogs moving about in varying modalities. In simple language, P.D. Eastman describes different facets of normal human life – work, play, sleep, and socialization (the story concludes with a big dog party).
    <p>
      A dialogue reoccurs between two dogs in which one dog asks the other dog, “Do you like my hat?” The two dogs meet in a number of scenarios and settings – scootering, skiing, and at a party. The motif illustrates plot, character, and relationship development. In each meeting, the hats become more extravagant.

      In the first few instances, the responding dog does not like the hat-wearing dog’s hat. When asked at the dog party, “Do you like my hat?” the responding dog exclaims:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    I do.<br />
    What a hat!<br />
    I like it!<br />
    I like that party hat!
    </blockquote>

      The story is often misattributed as a Dr. Seuss creation. While he did not write the story, he <i>did</i> edit the book. P.D. Eastman wrote and illustrated other classics such as: <i>Are You My Mother?</i>; <i>Red, Stop! Green, Go!</i>; and <i>Big Dog…Little Dog</i>.
