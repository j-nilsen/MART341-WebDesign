      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>As I was walkin' round Grosvenor Square<br />
        Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air<br />
        From the other direction, she was calling my eye<br />
        It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try<br />
        </p>
        <p>She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes<br />
        And I knew, without askin', she was into the blues<br />
        She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls<br />
        I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls<br />
        </p>
        <p>In the thick of the evening, when the dealing got rough<br />
        She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff<br />
        As I picked up my matches and was closing the door<br />
        I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before<br />
        </p>
        <p>Well, I ain't always right, but I've never been wrong<br />
        Seldom turns out the way it does in a song<br />
        Once in a while, you get shown the light<br />
        In the strangest of places if you look at it right<br />
        </p>
        <p> Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves<br />
        Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues<br />
        And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes<br />
        Had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by<br />
        </p>
        <p> Wind in the willows playin' "Tea For Two"<br />
        The sky was yellow, and the sun was blue<br />
        Strangers stoppin' strangers just to shake their hand<br />
        Everybody's playing in the Heart of Gold Band, Heart of Gold Band<br />
        </p>
