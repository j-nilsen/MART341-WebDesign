## ReadMe Qs
  1. We use a number of elements & attributes to categorize and structure a page
      - ```<div>```: block-line element – allows us to group elements together on the page
      - ```<class>```: attribute – allows us to group similar types of elements together for styling
      - ```<id>```: attribute - functions similar to ```<class>``` but can only be used for one element
      - ```<span>```: in-line element – acts similarly to that of a parenthesis within a bracket: serving a function within the same function; akin to ```<div>``` but does not create a full-width block


  2. Hosting services take the leg work out of compatibility, encoding, and storage. Self-hosting gives us more control and access over our content

  3. I found the ```<iframe>``` element to be worrisome. I appreciated the embedding function YouTube, Google, and Internet Archive offered, but felt I was left in the dark as to what was going on. Also: I had some formatting issues within my ```<style>``` element. Luckily, both issues were straightened out with trial & error. Toggling between Atom and my browser helped me track down the source of my problems (or worries).
