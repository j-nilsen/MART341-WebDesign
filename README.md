# John Nilsen's MART341-WebDesign
Repository for MART341 homework

In Week 2, we began to learn the ins and outs of web directories. For Assignment 2, I created this MART341-WebDesign repository. Within this repository, you will find a directory titled "Assignment_02." This new directory contains two items: a screenshot and a text file titled "responses.txt." As far as challenges go: I am wrestling with proper naming conventions. My experience with GIS instilled the importance of file maintenance. While I feel I am succeeding in this endeavor, I will keep a keen eye on file organization.
