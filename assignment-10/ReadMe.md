## ReadMe Qs
1.  The difference in the universal, element, class, and id selector types lies in what they modify. You might use a universal selector when you want to maintain a theme throughout a page. Using an ID selector would be helpful when stylizing a more specific set of elements within the page.
- Universal selectors will stylize *every* element on the page
  - Denoted by: ```*```
- Element selectors will stylize a type of element (i.e. ```<h1>```) found within a page
  - Whenever ```<h1>``` is employed, it will adhere to the rules set forth in the ```<style>```attribute
- Class selectors stylize defined class elements
  - Denoted by: ```.```
- ID selectors stylize defined ID elements
  - Denoted by: ```#```

2. The colors I chose were intended to be muted yet bold. I found inspiration in the 1940s catalogs I leafed through while researching my decade. The colors were taken from the [awwwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/trendy-web-color-palettes-and-material-design-color-schemes-tools.html) page linked under the **Using Color** > **Learn More** tab (MART 341 Website).
    - Hex Codes used:
      - ```#3d6d79``` ```#d69d66``` ```#e0e2ee``` ```#ffffff```
      

3. I was a little overwhelmed by having to toggle between ```style.css```, ```index.html```, and the browser. I ran into a couple snags where unintended elements were taking on different styles. I would duplicate my problem (i.e., a```<div class>```) directly below itself with a copy & paste. There, I felt I could safely toy around with selectors without fear of losing any work. Having a space to make mistakes (without sacrificing any progress) feels reassuring.
