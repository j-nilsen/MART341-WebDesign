  <h1>Crisped Chickpeas with Herbs and Garlic Yogurt</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>1 small garlic clove, minced or microplane-d</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>Salt and red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Olive oil – no need to bust out the <abbr title="Extra Virgin Olive Oil">evoo</abbr></li>
      <li>Half a large lemon</li>
      <li>1 small zucchini (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Handful of chopped fresh mint, oregano, basil, parsley, or a mix thereof</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h3>Chickpea, Yogurt Prep</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread chickpeas out in a single layer on a paper towel or two and roll around to pat dry
        <ul>
          <li>Leave until ready to fry</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Stir together garlic, yogurt, and a couple pinches of salt on a plate until mixed</li>
      <li>Spread to cover most of bottom of plate</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Chickpeas</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat <dfn title="a measurement that just barely fills the volume measure that it describes, i.e. a 'scant cup' would be just under the top of the cup measure, rather than level or heaping over">scant</dfn> 4 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat</li>
      <!-- Definition taken from Chef Lance Nitahara -->
      <li>Add chickpeas and cook, stirring to ensure they color evenly, until golden and crispy – about 10 minutes</li>
        <ul>
          <li>They’re going to crackle and pop as they fry; be careful or use a splatter screen if you have one</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Use a slotted spoon, transfer the chickpeas to paper towels to drain briefly then season well</li>
      <li>While still very hot, season with finely grated lemon zest, fine sea salt, and pepper flakes</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Zucchini</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add another tablespoon or so of oil if needed to the pan and warm again over medium-high</li>
        <li>Add the zucchini</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You will not fit it all in one layer and that’s fine, just leave it there until browned underneath</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Turn in sections, repeating the don’t-move-until-browned pause until the zucchini is tender and browned in spots</li>
        <li>Season well with salt and pepper</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Slide zucchini onto prepared yogurt</li>
        <li>Cut the zested lemon half into two wedges</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Drizzle hot zucchini with juice from one of the wedges</li>
            <li>Place the second on the side of the plate for serving</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Sprinkle half of chickpeas on top of zucchini (save the second half of the chickpeas for next time)</li>
        <li>Finish with a small drizzle of olive oil and fresh herbs – eat right away</li>
      </ol>
