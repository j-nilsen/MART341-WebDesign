## ReadMe Qs
1. A page can only have one main document ```<head>``` and ```<body>``` element. These differ from other HTML elements in that they indicate information regarding the bones of the page. Other elements are more indicative of style & formatting (structural, semantic markup). ```<head>``` contains "high-level information about the site," while ```<body>``` is where data "is rendered by the browser and displayed."

2. Structural markup is responsible for the organization of a page, i.e. line-breaks, horizontal lines, headings. Semantic markup seeks to emphasize (or clarify) information *on* the page, i.e. quotations, citations, definitions.

  The difference lies in what is being formatted â€“ the **document** itself (structural) or the **information** on the document (semantic).

3. For this assignment, I toggled between Atom and my browser often (Atom > Packages > Open in Browser). I also used Professor Cassens' example repository as a guide & inspiration. For the setup, I referenced my assignment-05 project folder as well as the MART341 Homework 5 PDF (last week's assignment). During the project, I found myself looking back at previous modules to refresh my memory on particular functions. I really enjoyed this assignment.
